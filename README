Michael's GridWorld Contestant Linker

This program takes the Actors in ./contestants/ and randomly places them in a bounded grid
of a certain size.

Usage: ./link [rows columns] [-fast]
  rows     the number of rows of the grid (default 20)
  columns  the number of columns of the grid (default 20)
  -fast    without -fast, link will explicitely compile GridWorld

Contestants
    A contestant is an Actor that has a constructor with no parameters.

    Put contestant *.java files in ./contestants.

    for example, ./contestants/Hopper.java and ./contestants/Jumper.java will both be 
    placed in the grid.

Bugs
    GridWorld uses some deprecated/unsafe/unchecked java 'features'.

    GridWorld sometimes starts with a blank grid when it should start with one that has
    actors in it. Retrying with 'java Main' should probably fix it. (This is probably due
    to the bug above).
